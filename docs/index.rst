Template Python Project
=======================

This project exists to give me and anyone else who would like to use it a template to
work off of that has a decent testing pipeline that is platform independent.  When you
create a new project change this description to describe the basic purpose of your
project.

The structure of this project is discussed in greater detail in the sub_projects link
below.
